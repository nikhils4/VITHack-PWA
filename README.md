# VIT Hack - Progressive Web App

This repository contains the files for the progressive web app of the VIT Hack which is live at [PWA](https://vithackpwa.netlify.com/). VIT Hack was 36 hours hackathon which was held on 20, 21 and 22 of September 2019.

VIT Hack aims to provide a platform for participants, including but not limited to Indian students, to contribute their ideas as solutions to real-world problems. In this global event, we hope to create a confluence of different cultures and ideas from around the world. Tracks related to emerging technologies aim to expand the participants’ horizons so as to spark innovation. Problem statements will also be driven towards social causes to help channel the participants’ thoughts into impactful change. Participants will be given the opportunity to learn, to grow and to adapt their ideas into the change they wish to see.
